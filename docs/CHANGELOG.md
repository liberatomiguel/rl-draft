## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-11

First playable build (MVP 1 + collection/progression slice).

### Added
- Classic Draft: free-choice draft over 6 slots (3 players, coach, sub, org)
  from randomly drawn historical lineups; person-level draft exclusion;
  player-as-substitute rule; forced free skip; rerolls by difficulty.
- Difficulties Easy / Normal / Hard + unlockable Legacy (win on Hard).
- Overall visibility toggle; locked hidden on Hard/Legacy; full reveal on the
  results screen (card-flip animation).
- Base card rarities (silver / gold / blue) + hidden "??" black cards.
- 10 special cards (rare/epic/mythic/legendary) with situational effects and
  the draft-and-finish unlock rule; collection album with filters, rarity
  progress and detail modal.
- Tournament: 16-team Swiss (Bo5, pre-computed next pairings, live standings)
  into single-elimination Bo7 playoffs (8 teams, seeded bracket); skippable
  game-by-game series ticker with broadcast-tone narration.
- Chemistry system (lineup / country / org / coach / sub links) with tiers
  and review breakdown; org buffs; coach bonuses; sub depth bonuses.
- Results screen: placement, highlights (best player, biggest win, closest
  series, toughest loss), XP breakdown with difficulty/hidden modifiers, rank
  progress, achievements, special unlocks.
- Progression: XP, 8 RL-inspired ranks, 13 achievements, run history (25),
  profile screen with reset.
- Hand-curated dataset: 24 lineups · 72 player cards · 49 players · 16 orgs ·
  12 coaches · 4 subs · 11 seasons (2016 → 2023-24, all six regions).
- Zod validation + referential integrity for the whole dataset.
- Seeded, reload-deterministic RNG; runs resume after refresh.
- Test suite (26 tests): dataset integrity, draft rules, chemistry, Swiss
  structure, simulation sanity anchors, full-run integration.
- Docs: architecture, data guide, balance guide, design decisions, roadmap.

### Balance
- Initial values for every knob in `src/config/balance.ts` (see
  BALANCE-GUIDE.md). Simulation anchors verified by tests:
  equal ratings ≈ 50/50 · +2 ≈ 65-75% · +6 ≥ 85% · +12 ≥ 97% per series.

### Fixed
(pre-release QA, kept for the record)
- **Simulation was far too deterministic** — a +2 rating edge won ~93% of
  Bo5 series because per-game noise averages out across a best-of. Root
  cause: single noise source. Fix: added a per-series "form" roll
  (`SIMULATION.seriesFormRange`) that does not average out; consistency and
  defense-stability dampen its negative side.
- **User team region was computed from the first pick only** (display bug in
  `engine/teams.ts`).
- **"Best player" highlight ignored the actual card overalls** (used the team
  average for every candidate).
- **Series ticker could label a Bo7 as Bo5** when the series ended in 5 games.
- **Going 3-0 in Swiss auto-simulated the entire playoffs** (caught in the
  first visual playtest). Root cause: "user advanced" was treated as "user has
  no series left", triggering the fast-forward meant for eliminations. Fix:
  rounds now auto-resolve only while the user has no pending series
  (`userHasPendingSeries`), stopping at the user's next playoff matchup; a
  "Playoff spot secured" panel covers the waiting state.
